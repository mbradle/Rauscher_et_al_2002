# Rauscher_et_al_2002

This notebook allows you to explore nucleosynthesis yields from the [Rauscher et al. (2002)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...576..323R/abstract) stellar models.  You may plot and download pre-explosion and post-explosion mass fractions as a function of interior mass coordinate. You can run the notebook on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge at the end of this paragraph.  You will need to sign in with your Google account.  Execute the whole notebook by clicking on Run all from the Runtime menu (you will click on Run anyway if an authorship warning appears).  You can then change inputs or code in the notebook, as desired.  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mbradle/Rauscher_et_al_2002/blob/main/Rauscher_et_al_2002.ipynb)

It is also possible to run the notebook on [Binder](https://mybinder.org).  To do so, click on the badge at the end of this paragraph.  Due to memory limitations on Binder, the notebook does not yet run optimally on this platform, so we currently recommend using Colab.

Alternatively, you can run on your local computer.  To do so, once you have installed [the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), download the linked notebook above (right-click or control-click).  To run the notebook from the command line, type, for example,

**jupyter notebook Rauscher_et_al_2002.ipynb**

Be sure to remove any suffix that is not *.ipynb* on the notebook file you download.  For example, some browsers will by default add a *.txt* to the downloaded file so that it has suffix *.ipynb.txt*.  Remove the *.txt* before running.
